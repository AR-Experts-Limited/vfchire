        <h1>Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: June 18, 2025</em></p>
        
        <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>

        <h2>2. Legal Framework</h2>
        <p>This policy is guided by the principles of the <strong>Equality Act 2010</strong>, which provides the legal framework for protecting the rights of individuals and advancing equality of opportunity for all. We adhere to the codes of practice issued by the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Protected Characteristics</h2>
        <p>We are committed to providing equal opportunities and preventing discrimination against anyone based on the nine protected characteristics defined by the Equality Act 2010. These are:</p>

            <li><strong>Harassment:</strong> Unwanted behaviour related to a protected characteristic which violates an individual’s dignity or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Victimisation:</strong> Treating someone unfairly because they have complained about discrimination or harassment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For further explanation, please see the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/equality/equality-act-2010/your-rights-under-equality-act-2010/direct-and-indirect-discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EHRC's guidance on the types of discrimination</a>.</p>
