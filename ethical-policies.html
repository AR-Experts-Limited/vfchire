        <h1>Ethical Policies</h1>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Pay Equity Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Our Commitment to Pay Equity</h3>
        <p>VFC Hire Ltd. is fundamentally committed to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. We believe that all our employees deserve to be compensated fairly and equitably for their contributions, regardless of gender or any other protected characteristic.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to eliminate any pay disparities and maintain a transparent and fair compensation structure across the entire organization.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Legal Framework</h3>
        <p>This policy is governed by the equal pay provisions within the <strong>Equality Act 2010</strong>. We ensure our pay practices comply with the legal requirements for "like work," "work rated as equivalent," and "work of equal value."</p>
        <p>We follow the official guidance provided in the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/equal-pay-statutory-code-practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EHRC's Equal Pay Statutory Code of Practice</a> to inform our policies and procedures.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Principles of Our Pay Policy</h3>
        <p>Our compensation decisions are based on objective criteria, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The skills, qualifications, and experience required for the role.</li>
            <li>The level of responsibility and accountability associated with the position.</li>
            <li>The performance of the individual employee.</li>
            <li>Market rates for similar roles within our industry and geographic location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pay decisions will not be influenced by an employee's gender, race, disability, or any other protected characteristic.</p>

        <h3>4. Pay Audits and Reviews</h3>
        <p>To uphold our commitment, VFC Hire Ltd. will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct regular pay audits to identify, understand, and address any gender pay gaps or other disparities.</li>
            <li>Utilize analytical job evaluation schemes to ensure that roles are valued consistently and fairly.</li>
            <li>Review salaries at all stages of employment, including recruitment, promotion, and annual pay reviews, to ensure equity is maintained.</li>
            <li>Take prompt and appropriate action to rectify any unjustifiable pay inequalities that are discovered.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Transparency and Communication</h3>
        <p>We are committed to being transparent about our pay and reward processes. Employees are entitled to ask questions about our pay policy and how their own pay is determined without fear of reprisal. We will clearly communicate the criteria and processes used to make compensation decisions.</p>

        <h2>Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement</h2>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the <strong>Modern Slavery Act 2015</strong> and constitutes VFC Hire Ltd.'s slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings.</p>
        <p>Further information on the act can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/modern-slavery-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Government's official website</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Our Business and Organisational Structure</h3>
        <p>VFC Hire Ltd. is a vehicle rental company based in Manchester, United Kingdom. Our primary operation involves the self-drive hire of commercial vans to both personal and business customers. Our structure is centralised, with all operations managed from our head office.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Our Supply Chains</h3>
        <p>Our supply chains include sourcing vehicles from major automotive manufacturers, procurement of vehicle parts and maintenance services, and utilising professional services. We recognise the highest risk of modern slavery lies further down these supply chains and are committed to working with our suppliers to ensure they adhere to the highest ethical standards.</p>

        <h3>4. Due Diligence and Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expect our key suppliers to have their own policies and controls to combat modern slavery.</li>
            <li>Include clauses in our supplier contracts that require compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.</li>
            <li>Will not knowingly support or deal with any business involved in slavery or human trafficking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Training and Awareness</h3>
        <p>To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery, we will provide training to relevant members of staff and ensure our company values are communicated to all suppliers and contractors.</p>
